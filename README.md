# Colors Check

## Description

An app to test the color combination balance in the webpage.

This test follows the 60-30-10 rule to choose colors. Acording to this
rule, you just need three colors to style your
web. 60 percent is neutral color (whitespaces and
backgrounds). 30 percent is primary color (common texts and lines),
And 10 percent is accent color (buttons
and important texts).

Here is what the app looks like:
